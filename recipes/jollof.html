    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a Jollof rice recipe</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>cooking oil</li>
        <li>Tomato paste</li>
        <li>sweet corn & pepper mix</li>
        <li>seasoning</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps for preparing</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> In a food processor or blender, combine your tomatoes, red pepper, and scotch bonnet peppers for around 45 seconds, making sure to blend everything well</li>
        <li> Heat the oil in a medium-sized pot over medium-high heat. The onions you left aside should be added to the heating 
            oil and fried until golden brown. Add the tomato paste and continue to sauté for two to three minutes after the onions have gone brown. Subsequently, incorporate the blended tomato combination (save around 1/4 cup and keep it aside)
             and cook it together with the onions and tomato paste for approximately half an hour. Stirring frequently will prevent
              the tomato mixture from burning.</li>
        <li> Reduce the heat to medium and stir in the chicken stock after 30 minutes. Add the Knorr stock cube, 
            salt, curry powder, thyme, and all-purpose seasoning. Mix well. Boil for a further ten minutes.</li>
        <li>To the pot, add the parboiled rice. Combine it thoroughly with the stewed tomatoes. At this point, feel free to add more water if necessary to bring the rice up to the level 
            of the tomato combination or chicken stock. After adding the bay leaves, cover the saucepan and let it cook for 15 to 30 minutes over medium to low heat.</li>
        <li>Once the liquid is almost entirely dry, add the leftover tomato stew, cover, and simmer for five to ten minutes over high heat.
             Once you’ve fully combined and turned off the heat, your Jollof rice is ready to eat!</li>
    </ol>
